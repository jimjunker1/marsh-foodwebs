This symmetrical web of Carpinteria Salt Marsh is comprised of 4 subwebs denoted by solid lines (clockwise: predator-prey, parasite-host, predator-parasite, parasite-parasite).  Consumers in columns, prey/hosts in rows.  Numerical entries represent links.  Different values represent different types of links.
N  = a confirmed link
N.1 represents a proposed/presumed link

0 = no link
1 = first intermediate host
1.2 = first and second intermediate host
1.25 first and second intermediate host, excysts outside 2nd intermediat host.
2 = second intermediate host
2.5 = second intermediate host external (non-trophic) cyst
3 = final host
4 = predator-prey
4.11 = 4.1
4.2 = egg predator
5 = predation on free-living cercarial stage of a trematode
6 = micropredation (mosquito)
7 = predation on parasite in a host
8 = predation on parasite in a host, transmission to predator possible
9 = parasite - parasite (mostly intraguild predation)
